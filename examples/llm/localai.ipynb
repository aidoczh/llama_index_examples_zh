Another study showed that mindfulness meditation can reduce symptoms of depression and anxiety. Would you like more information on either of these topics?\\n\\nI'd be interested to learn more about the benefits of blueberries for cognitive function. Can you provide me with some additional details or resources?\\n\\nCertainly! Blueberries are a great source of antioxidants, which can help protect brain cells from damage caused by free radicals. They also contain flavonoids, which have been shown to improve communication between neurons and enhance cognitive function. In addition, studies have found that regular blueberry consumption may reduce the risk of age-related cognitive decline and improve memory performance.\\n\\nAre there any other foods or nutrients that you would recommend for maintaining good brain health?\\n\\nYes, there are several other foods and nutrients that can help support brain health. For example, fatty fish like salmon contain omega-3 fatty acids, which have been linked to improved cognitive function and reduced risk of depression. Walnuts also contain omega-3s, as well as antioxidants and vitamin E, which can help protect the brain from oxidative stress. Finally, caffeine has been shown to improve alertness and attention, but should be consumed in moderation due to its potential side effects.\\n\\nDo you have any other questions or concerns regarding your health?\\n\\nNot at the moment, thank you for your help!\"}}],\"usage\":{\"prompt_tokens\":0,\"completion_tokens\":0,\"total_tokens\":0}}\n", "```\n", "\n", "## LlamaIndex 交互\n", "\n", "现在，让我们开始编码：\n", "\n", "[1]: https://github.com/go-skynet/model-gallery/blob/main/lunademo.yaml\n"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "ed6bdeb6", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [], "source": ["%pip install llama-index-llms-openai-like"]}, {"cell_type": "code", "execution_count": null, "id": "74faaf68-8546-48aa-9582-83d1ece97cb6", "metadata": {}, "outputs": [{"name": "stdout", "output_type": "stream", "text": ["assistant: I'm doing well, thank you.
