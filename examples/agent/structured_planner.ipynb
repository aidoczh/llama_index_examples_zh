Interest rate risk is associated with fluctuations in interest rates affecting the company's refinanced term loan facilities and fixed rate notes. Investment risk involves the preservation of capital and meeting liquidity requirements without significantly increasing risk, with exposure to changes in interest rates and the carrying amounts of investments in other companies. Foreign currency risk arises from international transactions in multiple currencies, which could affect revenue and operating results due to fluctuations in exchange rates. Additionally, there are risks related to cyberattacks, which could harm the company's reputation, business, and operating results by compromising data security and the integrity of information technology systems.\n", "> Running step 04e95d17-e7a7-4f35-8519-33e9439e9659.
